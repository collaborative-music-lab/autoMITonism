# autoMITonism

This is a fork of Johan Eriksson's excellent Automatonism library for PureData:
https://www.automatonism.com
The purpose of this fork is to enable for community improvements to the existing library, notably fleshing out parameter receives for working with external controllers.

In addition, the possibility exists to modify the library to improve parameter storage, and potentially remove the requirement for the core automonatism modules to be in a strict folder hierarchy.
